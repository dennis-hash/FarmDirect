# FarmDirect
# ABSTRACT
Agricultural marketing encompasses all activities that add value to agricultural products as they move from rural agricultural production areas to final urban consumption areas. A successful and productive marketing system is required to ensure fair returns to farmers, but this sector receives little attention in Kenya.An effort has been made in this research to design and implement a Farm product and marketing system for farmers to showcase their agricultural products. Most farmers confuse marketing efficiency with marketing margins, physical losses, and market competition. HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, PHP, and SQL are the programming languages used. Because this is a web-based application, web-based programming was used.

**Problems facing existing system	
All of these are issues with the current Agricultural Marketing Information System:
i. A lack of transparency in farm produce prices.

ii. There is no formal method of promoting farm produce to the general public.
iii. Customers' inability to obtain concurrent information about the availability of a specific farm produce in the market.
iv. Damages and price drops in perishable produce such as tomatoes, watermelon, and so on as a result of insufficient information about their availability in a specific market.

**Solution to the problems**
The problems created by the manual agricultural marketing information system shall all be a thing of the past when the proposed Web Based Agricultural Marketing Information System is implemented to take over all the affairs of marketing information of farm products in Kenya.
